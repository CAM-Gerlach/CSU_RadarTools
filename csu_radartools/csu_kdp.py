csu_kdp v1.1

Change Log
----------
v1.1 Major Changes (04/27/2015):
1. Made algorithm work with a user-defined gate spacing (via gs keyword).
   Untested on gate spacings that do not divide evenly into the 3-km window
   used for filtering the PHIDP data, however. But common gate spacings
   like 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 meters should all work fine.
2. Made the algorithm capable of receiving 2D array inputs (i.e., azimuth &
   range) as well as 1D inputs (range only). If 2D, rng needs to be 2D as
   well. However, thsd should remain a scalar, or 1D and only vary by range.

To Do
-----
1. Performance improvements
2. Make object-oriented

    Overview
    --------
    This is an old algorithm that uses an FIR filter to process differential
    phase and extract specific differential phase. It works on polarimetric
    radar data. It is based on code provided by V. N. Bringi and Yanting Wang
    of CSU Electrical Engineering. It assumes differential phase has been
    unfolded already. You can send this function either 1D or 2D arrays of
    data. If 2D, it assumes the first index is azimuth so it will loop over
    that, calculating KDP along individual rays.

    Steps
    -----
    1. Standard deviation of differential phase is calculated and used to 
       QC the phase data. The stdev calculation uses up to 11 consecutive
       gates regardless of gate spacing.
    2. Differential phase is filtered using the FIR filter, which has been
       tuned to the number of gates contained within the 3-km window. This
       algorithm has only been tested for 3 km / gate spacing = even number.
    3. Specific differential phase is calculated by consulting reflectivity.
       As reflectivity declines progressively more and more gates are needed
       in the window used to fit a line to the filtered phase. Specific
       differential phase is half the slope of that line.

          use np.meshgrid() first tp make rng 2D if needed)
    thsd = Threshold for standard deviation of differential phase, above which 
           the data are not considered when filtering or calculating specific
           differential phase. The user can specify a 1D vector of spatially
           varying thresholds instead (i.e., vary by range).

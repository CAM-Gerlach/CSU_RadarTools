    Overview
    --------
    This is a decade+ old algorithm that uses a 21-pt FIR filter to process
    differential phase and extract specific differential phase.
    It works on individual rays of polarimetric radar data. It is based on code
    provided by V. N. Bringi and Yanting Wang of CSU Electrical Engineering.
    It assumes differential phase has been unfolded already.
    
    Steps
    -----
    1. Standard deviation of differential phase is calculated and used to QC the 
       phase data.
    2. Differential phase is filtered. 
    3. Specific differential phase is calculated by consulting reflectivity. 
       As reflectivity declines progressively more and more gates are needed
       in the window used to fit a line to the filtered phase. Specific
       differential phase is half the slope of that line.

    Arguments
    ---------
    dp = Differential phase (deg, vector)
    dz = Reflectivity (dBZ, vector)
    rng = Range (km, vector)
    thsd = Threshold for standard deviation of differential phase, above which 
           the data are not considered when filtering or calculating specific
           differential phase. The user can specify a vector of spatially
           varying thresholds instead (e.g., vary by range).
    nfilter = Number of times to apply the FIR filter
    bad = Value for bad/missing data
    
    Returns
    -------
    kd_lin = Specific differential phase (deg/km, vector)
    dp_lin = Filtered differential phase (deg, vector)
    sd_lin = Standard deviation of differential phase (deg, vector)

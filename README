Python tools for polarimetric radar retrievals.

This codebase was developed at Colorado State University by numerous people,
including Brenda Dolan, Brody Fuchs, Kyle Wiens, Rob Cifelli, Larry Carey, and others

Currently, fuzzy-logic-based hydrometeor identification, blended rainfall,
and liquid/ice mass calculations are supported.

These are supplied as standalone functions that take polarimetric radar data
as arguments. Scalars and arrays are supported as function inputs.

To install:
python setup.py install
(you may need to have sudo privileges, depending on your setup)

To access, use the following in your analysis code:
from csu_radartools import csu_fhc, csu_liquid_ice_mass, csu_blended_rain

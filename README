Python tools for polarimetric radar retrievals.

This codebase was developed at Colorado State University by numerous people,
including Brenda Dolan, Brody Fuchs, Kyle Wiens, Rob Cifelli, Larry Carey, Timothy Lang,
and others.

Currently, fuzzy-logic-based hydrometeor identification, blended rainfall,
DSD retrievals, and liquid/ice mass calculations are supported. There is also a simple
algorithm for calculating specific differential phase for radars w/ 150-m gate spacing.

These are supplied as standalone functions that take polarimetric radar data
as arguments. Scalars and arrays are supported as function inputs. The only exception
is csu_kdp.calc_kdp_bringi() which requires individual rays of radar data. 

To install:
python setup.py install
(you may need to have sudo privileges, depending on your setup)

To access, use the following in your analysis code:
from csu_radartools import (csu_fhc, csu_liquid_ice_mass, csu_blended_rain, csu_dsd, 
                            csu_kdp, csu_misc)

For help information do help on individual modules. There is also a demonstration IPython notebook in the notebooks directory. Currently, this notebook covers the csu_fhc, csu_liquid_ice_mass, csu_blended_rain, and csu_dsd modules. More modules will be added to this notebook in the future.

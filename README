Python tools for polarimetric radar retrievals.
Currently, fuzzy-logic-based hydrometeor identification, blended rainfall,
and liquid/ice mass calculations are supported.

These are suppliesd as standalone functions that take polarimetric radar data
as arguments. Scalars and arrays are supported as function inputs.

To install:
python setup.py install
(you may need to have sudo privileges, depending on your setup)

To access, use the following in your analysis code:
from csu_radartools import csu_fhc, csu_liquid_ice_mass, csu_blended_rain
